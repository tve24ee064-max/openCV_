# OpenCV Learning Projects

This repository contains my OpenCV learning journey with various computer vision projects.

## Projects

### Task 1: Basic Image Processing
- Reading and displaying images
- Converting images to grayscale
- Pixel manipulation and color channels
- Creating a 4x4 chessboard pattern

### Task 2: Webcam and Video
- Real-time webcam capture
- Video recording with different codecs
- Setting video properties (resolution, FPS)

### Task 3: Additional Samples
- Further image processing experiments

### Task 4: Dino Game
- Interactive game using OpenCV
- Collision detection
- Real-time rendering with cv2

### Task 5: Image Cartoonification
- Bilateral filtering for smooth colors
- Edge detection using adaptive threshold
- Creating cartoon-style images

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run any script:
```bash
python task/sample1.py
python task2/sample2vdo.py
python task4/dinogame.py
python task5/cartoonification.py
```

## Controls

### Dino Game
- **SPACE** - Jump
- **Q** - Quit
- **R** - Restart after game over

### Video/Image Display
- Press any key to close windows
- **Q** - Quit video capture
